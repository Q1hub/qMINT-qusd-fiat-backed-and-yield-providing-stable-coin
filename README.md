# qMINT/qUSD – FINAL SYSTEM (Live the second Banxa card rails launch)

**Only one way to mint qUSD. Forever.**

| User action                     | Minimum order          | Total cost to user (incl. Banxa ~1–2% spread) | What the protocol receives                               | What the user gets instantly | Peg guarantee                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| “Buy qUSD with card” (one tap)  | **50 qUSD**            | **$75.00 – $77.50**                            | • $50.00 real USD → Treasury (1:1 backing)<br>• $25.00 – $27.50 worth of QUBIC (the “mint fee”) | **Exactly 50.0000 qUSD**     | 100% backed by the real $50 USD that was just paid |

### The ~$25–$27.50 QUBIC mint fee is split forever like this

| Percentage | Destination                                 | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **50%**    | Locked forever in qEarn                     | Generates perpetual staking yield → paid as **extra APY to anyone who locks their qUSD** |
| **20%**    | Treasury / project fund                     | CEX listings, audits, marketing, liquidity pairs, partnerships         |
| **20%**    | Dev team wallet (multi-sig)                 | Pays the builders who ship and maintain everything                      |
| **10%**    | Immediate QUBIC burn (dead address)         | Pure deflation – the community loves it                                 |

### User experience (exact flow)

1. Open official Qubic wallet → “Buy qUSD with card”  
2. Minimum: 50 qUSD ($75–$77.50 total)  
3. Pay with debit/credit card (100+ countries)  
4. In <15 seconds you receive **exactly 50.0000 qUSD**  
5. That qUSD is **forever backed 1:1 by real USD** in the Treasury  
6. Optional: lock your qUSD in the built-in staking module → earn yield from the 50% qEarn slice

### Key facts

- No over-collateral, no liquidation, no daily fees, no complexity  
- Every qUSD = real dollar paid by someone’s card  
- Protocol earns ~33–36% gross margin on every mint (the QUBIC portion)  
- Minimum kept at 50 qUSD to keep Banxa fees reasonable and discourage micro-spam

### Wallet screen one-liner

“Buy minimum 50 qUSD with card for ~$76.  
Real 1:1 USD backing + earn yield by locking. Protocol keeps ~$26 QUBIC profit per order.”

This is the final, permanent system.  
When Banxa goes live → we go live with exactly this.  
Nothing else exists anymore.

Copy, paste, ship, dominate.
